# boost-gradle
Boost Gradle repository

This is an initial attempt at using the greeting plugin to have a dependency on the
liberty gradle plugin that will install liberty locally. 

This is an exercise in attempting to understand Plugin relationships for Gradle

run this as ./gradlew boost  This will run a boost task that installs liberty from the liberty gradle plugin and
prints out a message from a task in the new plugin
